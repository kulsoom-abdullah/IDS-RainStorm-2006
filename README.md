# Network Security Visualization
![Alt text](https://github.com/kulsoom-abdullah/NetworkSecurityVisualization/blob/master/screenshots/Slide09.png "Optional Title")

### This respository contains the following:
* **main** folder - contains the Java and JOGL (Java OPENGL extensions) code for the prototype I developed for my PhD thesis, called, *IDS RainStorm*.
* **screenshots** folder - contains a few screenshots of the visual tool 
* **screenshots_presentation.pdf** - Is a presentation that describes the *IDS Rainstorm* tool, the prototype, as well as screenshots of use cases.  Also described is another network security visualization tool I worked on post PhD with then PhD student Troy Nunnaly which he developed for his thesis.

####Summary:
###### Why Information Visualization & Network Security
* Network traffic capacity is greater than systems can process
* Network attacks have not decreased, current security tools are insufficient
* Information visualization techniques used in network security research have initial success and future promise
* Text logs and machine learning algorithms are complemented and information is represented more densely.

###### Network data & graph scaling issues 
* Graph occlusion
  * Avoid overlap and occlusion in the visualizations
* Scaling data parameters ranges
 * For networking, port numbers & IP addresses need scaling
     * 65535 TCP and UDP ports
     * 4 billion possible IP addresses 
* Time scaling
 * Needs to be either small or large depending on activity
     * small for quick activities: fast network scans, DoS, fast propagating worms
     * large for slow network scans, overall trends in a network
