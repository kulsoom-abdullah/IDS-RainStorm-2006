# IDS-RainStorm-2006
These are the java and class files for the prototype I coded for my PhD thesis.  Final version year 2006.
Currently, I have not gotten the current JOGL (Java OpenGL) jar files to work with this code and be able to run the Demo for today in 2016.

I am including a PDF file of slides that describe the project, and includes screenshots of this and the next security viz project I worked on post PhD with a PhD then student Troy Nunnaly.
